# Fotomatic

This project was about positioning / layout and responsive design

- As the page shrinks you notice a few differences
- The sign up section dissapears in mobile view
- Some of the pictures lower down the body also dissapear as not to make them to small for the user

# Static

This is another example of a static site but gave me lots of practice using the box meathod and flex.
